Product.hasMany(Review, { as: "reviews", foreignKey: "productId" });
Review.belongsTo(Product, { as: "product", foreignKey: "productId" });





1. foreignKey

The foreignKey tells Sequelize which column in the child table (Review) links back to the parent table (Product).

üëâ In this case:

productId column exists in the reviews table.

That column stores the id of the product it belongs to.

So for example:

Products table

id	name
1	Soap
2	Pipe Wrench

Reviews table

id	productId	text
1	1	"Very good soap"
2	1	"Too small"
3	2	"Strong tool"

Here productId is the foreign key that connects Review ‚Üí Product.








2. as

The as is just an alias (a label) that Sequelize uses to refer to the relationship.

Product.hasMany(Review, { as: "reviews" }) ‚Üí means when you include reviews, Sequelize will return them as product.reviews.

Review.belongsTo(Product, { as: "product" }) ‚Üí means when you include the product from a review, Sequelize will return it as review.product.

If you don‚Äôt use as, Sequelize will try to guess the name (sometimes incorrectly, especially when you have multiple relations).

4. Summary

foreignKey ‚Üí actual column in the database that links the tables (reviews.productId).

as ‚Üí alias used in Sequelize code to refer to the relationship (product.reviews or review.product).

In your controller, Sequelize automatically fetches the reviews because you told it:

There‚Äôs a hasMany relation (Product ‚Üí Review).

The foreign key is productId.

The alias is reviews.






What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is a column in one table that points to the primary key of another table.

It creates a relationship between two tables.

Example in your case

You have three models:

1. User
id (PK)  |  name   |  email
---------|---------|----------
1        | Alice   | alice@mail.com
2        | Bob     | bob@mail.com

2. Product
id (PK)  |  name        |  price
---------|--------------|---------
10       | Phone        | 500
11       | Laptop       | 1000

3. Review
id (PK)  |  comment       | rating | userId (FK) | productId (FK)
---------|----------------|--------|-------------|--------------
100      | "Great phone!" | 5      | 1           | 10
101      | "Too costly"   | 3      | 2           | 11


üëâ Here:

userId is a foreign key that points to User.id.

productId is a foreign key that points to Product.id.

That means:

Review #100 was written by User #1 (Alice) about Product #10 (Phone).

Review #101 was written by User #2 (Bob) about Product #11 (Laptop).










1. üßë One-to-One (1:1)

‚û°Ô∏è One record in a table is linked to one record in another table.

Example:

A User has one Profile.

A Profile belongs to exactly one User.

Sequelize:

User.hasOne(Profile, { foreignKey: 'userId' });
Profile.belongsTo(User, { foreignKey: 'userId' });


Tables:

Users        Profiles
-----        --------
id (PK)      id (PK)
name         bio
             userId (FK ‚Üí Users.id)


üëâ userId in Profiles links each profile to one user.

2. üì¶ One-to-Many (1:N)

‚û°Ô∏è One record in a table can be linked to many records in another table.

Example:

A Product can have many Reviews.

Each Review belongs to exactly one Product.

Sequelize:

Product.hasMany(Review, { foreignKey: 'productId', as: 'reviews' });
Review.belongsTo(Product, { foreignKey: 'productId', as: 'product' });


Tables:

Products      Reviews
--------      -------
id (PK)       id (PK)
name          comment
              productId (FK ‚Üí Products.id)


üëâ productId in Reviews links multiple reviews to one product.

3. ü§ù Many-to-Many (M:N)

‚û°Ô∏è A record in one table can be linked to many records in another table ‚Äî and vice versa.

Example:

A User can buy many Products.

A Product can be bought by many Users.

You need a junction table (a middle table).

Sequelize:

User.belongsToMany(Product, { through: 'UserProducts', foreignKey: 'userId' });
Product.belongsToMany(User, { through: 'UserProducts', foreignKey: 'productId' });


Tables:

Users         Products       UserProducts
-----         --------       ------------
id (PK)       id (PK)        userId (FK ‚Üí Users.id)
name          name           productId (FK ‚Üí Products.id)


üëâ The UserProducts table holds connections between Users and Products.

üö¶ Quick Analogy (Real Life)

One-to-One ‚Üí A person has one passport.

One-to-Many ‚Üí A mother has many children.

Many-to-Many ‚Üí Students and classes (a student can join many classes, a class has many students).

üõ†Ô∏è How as and foreignKey fit in

foreignKey ‚Üí tells Sequelize what column links the tables.

as ‚Üí gives the relationship a readable name when fetching data.

Example:

Product.hasMany(Review, { foreignKey: 'productId', as: 'reviews' });


foreignKey: 'productId' ‚Üí Sequelize will look for productId in Review table.

as: 'reviews' ‚Üí you can later fetch like:

const product = await Product.findByPk(1, { include: 'reviews' });
